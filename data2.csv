"Grab a bottle of our Bourbon Barrel-Aged Bock!  Release Date:  Friday, 2/26!

The origin of the bock style can be traced all the way back to the 14th century where German brewers in the town of Einbeck began brewing dark, malty ales with little to no hop flavor. By the 17th century brewers in Munich were crafting lagers in the style of Einbeck, which they pronounced “ein Bock”, and the beer eventually came to be known simply as “bock.” Traditional bock is rich and smooth, celebrating the warm, toasty, and slightly sweet caramel flavors of roasted malts. At DuVig we aged this bock in oak bourbon barrels, imparting subtle hints of whiskey that enhance the malt flavor adding depth and complexity while also providing a perfect offset to the beer’s inherent sweeter profile.",1,0.7496,DuVig Brewing Company,14,0,1,Photo,02/25/2016 14:01:35

"When you tour our facility, signs read ""we do it differently"".  The same goes with our pilsner beer; a true lager.  I wait to have the beer drop from 12.6 Plato until 8 plato at this temp, then let it free rise until terminal gravity around 3.5 Plato.  It makes a truly authentic pilsner.  Only in our summer variety packs and limited draught, this pilsner will be ready come April.  Plan on tasting how we do it differently. #different #401 #pilsner",0,0.0413,Newport Storm Beer,6,0,0,Photo,02/23/2016 08:38:51

A few announcements we wanted to conglomerate in a single post before the week kicks off.  

Jack O Lambent has kicked, but the new batch of Auroral (mango/lychee this time) will be online this week (see picture)!  As with any fruited beer, if you like them super juicy we recommend grabbing as fresh as possible. 

If you good folks find yourselves in Portsmouth, you can grab us with a food pairing at Moxy all this week.  

March 10th is our next taco pop up with Vida Cantina NH!

The week of March 12th, Maryann will be holding down the tasting room and retail shop as Frank and I take a little jaunt to Tampa for Hunahpu’s Day® 2016!

And we are currently working out the details (it's looking very, very good), but we are incredibly honored to have been invited to the Vermont Brewers Festival in Burlington, VT this year in July!

"The countdown is on to Vinátta Release Day!  It is five days until the release at 4pm this Friday.  We are so excited to have you try this year's batch!  

Vinátta is a 12% Alc. by Vol. Russian Imperial Stout.  It takes 4 ""no sparge"" mashes over 36 hours to brew a single batch of Vinátta.  There is no barrel aging and no adjuncts in this beer,  just 12% of amazing, complex maltiness.  

People who taste Vinátta for the first time describe it in many different ways.  We have heard descriptors of leather, tobacco, chocolate, prunes and raisins.  One descriptor we don't hear is boozy.  This is a very smooth and deceptive 12% beer with a remarkable amount of complexity.  

Grab a friend and bring them to Kelsen on Friday.  

Price: $14 per 500ml bottle, limit 1 case per person per day",1,0.545,Kelsen Brewing Company,11,6,1,Photo,02/21/2016 16:00:08

"Currently on-tap at Schilling:

Paulus (Münchner Helles), 4.7% abv. Paulus (pronounced Pow'loos) is typical of the quaffable golden beers brewed for the Oktober and harvest festivals in Bavaria each fall. Paulus is malt-forward, yet hopped sufficiently with noble hops to provide balance. Refreshing and sessionable, Schilling first brewed this beer to mark our first anniversary.

Georg (Münchner Dunkles Lager), 5% abv. Georg (named in honor of our great-grandfather, George A. Schilling) is a complex, dark Bavarian-style lager with traditional Munich malt taking center stage, presenting notes of nuttiness and bread with a touch of caramel. While complex in flavor, this traditional brown lager is dry and sessionable. Prosit!

Randus (Sticke Ale), 6.8% abv. Randus is a ""sticke""--literally, ""secret""--German-style ale. Named after an eccentric character from our past--a pseudo-German rocker with wicked feathered hair--Randus showcases dark fruit notes, a beautiful amber coloration and a clea",0,0.2783,Schilling Beer Co.,8,2,3,Photo,02/20/2016 13:38:03

"Introducing our killer new Stout!  No, your eyes aren't deceiving you. Meet Stony Joe, the newest year round draft offering in the Stony Creek family of beers. A Golden Mocha (milk) Stout, Stony Joe is brewed with out a stout's traditional roasted malts. Instead we use a boat load of rich, decadent light colored barley, oats, and wheat to give it lush body and sweetness.  We then ferment it with Cocoa Nibs and add Guatemalan Coffee, roasted the day we use it, directly to the fermenter.  The cocoa nibs and coffee add rich mocha notes and coffee aroma.  We are excited to partner with Redding Roasters Coffee Company LLC on this exciting new beer.  Stop on by for a Cup of Joe.

"We would like to welcome our newest customer, the British Beer Company in Plymouth (downtown).  I am not sure why it has taken us almost 2 years to get them some beer, but this egregious oversight has now been rectified with a keg of Rye and Sage Saison.  If you haven't been to the littlest of all the BBCs (and the oldest), it is on Middle St in downtown Plymouth.  They were the first place in Plymouth to focus on craft beer and really paved the way for places like #NewWorldTavern, #DriftwoodPublickHouse, and #SpeedwellTavern. (I am learning how to use hashtags on Facebook today. So far so good).

Speaking of New World Tavern, Driftwood, and Speedwell, we just delivered the new Imperial Stout to each of them.  5 gallons each. They should be on tap soon.

Just a friendly reminder that we'll be open from 4-7pm tonight, 3-7pm Friday, and 12-5pm Saturday with 9 draft offerings, plenty of growlers to go, and 3 bottle conditioned offerings.   We pride ourselves on a wide breadth of styles.

Genotype is still bright (hazy, but bright in profile :P ) and fresh for growlers and tasters; and we also have tasters available of our Pilot double IPA for the hazy, hoppy folks along with several clearer hop profiles.  

We've got our multigrain porter Renascence and two Dormancy variants for the darker beer lovers.  

We've got Aggregation, Cumulation, Jack O Lambent, and Lambent for the sour, tart loving folks.  

And we've got Sepal for the farmhouse, funk lovers (more farmhouse stuff in tanks now).  

You can find the menu here (download from options menu if too small to read.  Image is full page resolution.):

"This Saturday... Oudilis, Oudilis Cerasus, Zymatore Caos, Fryborg + much much more... Here's some extra insight for ya:

Artista Zynergia is an international blending project between B. United International, OEC Brewing & fine producers from around the world.

Oudilis is an interpretation of a ""Belgian Style Gueuze"" with a slight tweak. This blend was done using 2 year old lambic ale from Hanssens Artisanaal and a ""Berliner Weisse"" style ale that was aged & soured in French Chardonnay & Ransom Spirits Pinot Noir/Gin barrels for 8 months. Available on draft and in 500ml bottles this Saturday, 2/20. Only 468 bottles available with a strict limit of 4 per customer. $16/btl. No holds or early sales on these bottles.

Oudilis Cerasus is an interpretation of a ""Belgisn Style Kriek"" with a slight tweak. This blend was done using 3 year old Hanssens Kriek with Schaarbeekse cherries and a sour saison that was matured 12 months in South African red wine barrels with fresh sour cherries from Tony",1,1.1098,OEC Brewing,40,7,1,Photo,02/17/2016 20:45:43

"GREEN DRINKS TONIGHT, 6 - 8:30pm!
""Every month people who work in the environmental field meet up at informal sessions known as Green Drinks.   
We have a lively mixture of people from NGOs, academia, government and business. Come along and you'll be made welcome. Just say, ""are you green?"" and we will look after you and introduce you to whoever is there. It's a great way of catching up with people you know and also for making new contacts. Everyone invites someone else along, so there’s always a different crowd, making Green Drinks an organic, self-organising network.
These events are very simple and unstructured, but many people have found employment, made friends, developed new ideas, done deals and had moments of serendipity.

With that in mind, it is probably a good day to mention that the Three River Farmers Alliance will be having their July-October 2016 CSA pickup at Throwback Brewery on Wednesdays from 4-7pm. And, if you are a member of the CSA, we will give you 10% off your Throwback beer purchases on the same day / times you pick up your share. This includes beer you drink at our pub or take to go. It’s our little way of thanking you for supporting the amazing local farms around here. Sign ups are happening now! Read our blog post for more information. Cheers!

Just a quick very sincere thank you to all the folks to came in and dropped off gift cards and pre-paid visa for the family we mentioned in our FB post yesterday. 

On... about 18 hours notice... we had large group of folks swing in and we raised a very respectable amount of money.  I feel funny publishing the number for some reason but I think folks should be very proud of what was raised for a very good cause. 

All of the proceeds should be delivered to the family tomorrow and there's no way it won't be a very REAL help. 

Thank you all so much and without getting too hokey about it... it was awesome to see a steady stream of folks in our line quietly ask if they could add to what we had collected. 

Really really cool and thank you again.

"Hey everyone,

We had an event at LuLu's in Allston last night and, apparently, as we were driving home to the Bog... there was a terrible fire at a home just around the corner from my house.  Our sons instantly remembered the home by what they give for Halloween every year.  

Luckily it sounds like there were no injuries but the house essentially burned to the ground and the family lost everything except the clothes they were wearing when they got out of the house.  

We've been extremely lucky at Bog Iron to get a huge amount of support every week from our little community and we're hoping a bit of that could be directed towards a neighbor in need here in town. 

We are working with some folks in Town Hall to try to see exactly what we can do but one thing that would be a huge immediate help to the family is the donation of pre-paid gift cards.  Any stores (Target, Wal-Mart, etc) and even pre-paid visas would go a long long way. 

We'll be collecting any gift cards folks are able to",1,2.6645,Bog Iron Brewing,59,2,22,Status,02/12/2016 17:59:19

New on tap today: 

• Oyster Stout (roasty and subtly briney)
• Sledding Through the Forest- Cascadian IPA

The  Cascadian IPA is the newest edition to our Unafraid of the Dark V series. It was brewed with Juniper and Balsam, so it’s drier, hoppier and has notes of pine and molasses. Yum!

Don't forget, we also have Cribbage tonight beginning at 6pm. Come play some games and drink some beers after the workday.

"Tomorrow is shaping up to be a pretty fun day here at Throwback Brewery! At 6pm, we will be playing cribbage (everyone is welcome!) Also, we are putting the latest Unafraid of the Dark V beer on tap. It is called Sledding Through the Forest, and it is a wonderfully piney Cascadian Dark Ale that will pair beautifully with Chef Carrie's specials for the day, which will include a steamed dumpling stuffed with a citrus & juniper duck confit and a warm charcuterie plate, made up of three of our house-made goodies – seared head cheese, house-made duck & cranberry sausage, house-smoked and cured ham. More details on these specials tomorrow. For now, check out the details on this latest beer! Cheers!

"In honor of Chris Costic Czech Your Ego goes on tap today. Every Winter we bring a special lager yeast into the brewery and make a series of lager style beers. We begin with the Bohemian Style Pilsner brewed with floor malted bohemian pilsner malt produced in Germany. We also managed to procure some truly excellent Czech Saaz. The malt provides a superb body and mouthfeel while the hops produce a wonderfully clean bitterness and a delicate floral finish. Lagers are very hard to brew well.... even the slightest flaws show up against the lighter background flavors and the cold brewing process can leave some off flavors behind. I've had my share of buttery lagers, or lagers that taste like corn in the past.

"Due to the snow, Overshores tasting room will be closed Friday, Feb. 5th.

Here's a recipe for Hot Honey Brun to make at home:
(1) 750 ml bottle of Overshores Tripel Brun
(1) lemon
Organic honey to taste
(1) cinnamon stick if desired

Pour Tripel Brun into medium-large pot (beer will foam as it heats, so nothing too small). Add cinnamon stick to pot.

Warm on low-medium heat to 170 deg F or until the liquid looks like it's about to simmer. DO NOT BOIL

Alcohol boils before water, so if it boils, you'll cook off the alcohol.

Pour hot Tripel Brun into your favorite mug, add honey to taste, garnish with a slice of lemon.

Our traditional recipe is made from wholesome natural ingredients, no flavorings, extracts, or preservatives.  We pack almost 500 pounds of fresh ground ginger into every batch, and ferment almost all of the sugars out, producing a dry, slightly fruity, clean, and crisp taste.

Noank Smack Oyster Stout Release

Mystic Seaport, the largest maritime museum in the world, holds many treasures. Among them are four ships designated as National Historic Landmarks. One of these vessels is the Emma C. Berry, the sole surviving American Noank smack.

A Noank smack was a fishing sloop with a unique design. It featured a large well amidships with circulating water to keep fish alive until it returned to port. These ships debuted in England in 1775 as ""well smacks."" By 1920, they were mostly obsolete. Remaining Noank smacks were either sunk or re-rigged, often as training vessels for young sailors.

In a nod to the rich maritime history of our region, Outer Light Brewing Company would like to present Noank Smack Oyster Stout.

We know what you’re thinking: Does it taste like oysters? In general, sometimes. In our case, no. Oyster stouts do not have to taste briny. The powerful malt background often overwhelms any hint of salt. Oyster",1,2.3226,Outer Light Brewing Company,64,3,5,Photo,02/03/2016 12:43:00

He owned Heavy Bag Media in New Haven, had tried our beers one night and couldn't believe we weren't on tap in every bar in New Haven. This bothered him enough to show up at the brewery and introduce himself and ask me the question of why doesn't anyone know about this beer? My answer was short and simple: I had no money. We shared a pint and talked and he invited me to come visit his company and team with his wife Jackie Peters. They were a great, young, talented and creative team and offered to brand our new IPA and build us our first website. For free. 
That act of kindness turned the brewery around and gave NEB identity and recognition. Sea Hag IPA 10 years later is one of the top CT brands and fuels the continued success we share at the brewery. Thank you, Dennis.

We're proud to announce that we've teamed up with the Lake Champlain Committee to help protect this lovely lake’s environmental integrity and recreational resources for this and future generations. 

Wee Heavy Champ is a Scotch Ale nearly as dark as the deepest depths of Lake Champlain. A rich, robust, yet smooth, malt character rises to the surface where notes of caramel, chocolate and wheat can be discovered. A light addition of hops is present for balance in this big, complex and soon-to-be legendary brew. Soon to be available in 22oz bottles and draft in Vermont and beyond!

"Congratulations are in order.

First,we would like to congratulate and thank the first customers to complete their Growler Club Cards.  This past weekend Drew O'Rourke took home his 8th growler and was the first to complete his card.  It wasn't much longer until Chris Oravec took the silver medal redeeming his 8th growler.  Coincidentally they were Growler Club cards #56 and #57.  We are still waiting for the bronze medalist to cross the finish line.

In case you don't know about the IndieFerm Growler Club: For $100 you get a 64 oz growler, a logo glass (either Belgian or pub style) and 8 growler fills.  Take as long as you want, the card won't expire until December 31, 2099.  Buying the card instead of paying as you go saves as much as $21 based on current prices.  And by now you know how the world works, prices only go up.

And we would also like to say congratulations to  (wait for it......): OURSELVES.  Because IndieFerm won the Beer vs. Wine Dinner last week at Bear in Boots Gastr",1,2.6838,Independent Fermentations Brewing,19,4,0,Link,02/02/2016 08:56:10

"Pick Your Own is returning as a brewery only release on February 13th! Doors will open at 9:30am. 
This beer begins as a sour red aged in an oak foudre with lactobacillus and pediococcus for 2 years. We then add fresh, local raspberries, cherries, strawberries, and blueberries and age it for an additional three months. PYO is vibrant red, tart, juicy, and dominated by big berry flavors.

"It is with great sadness that I share the passing of Todd's father Joseph Louis Marcus at 74 years of age. Joe Marcus, husband of 52 years to Sheila Marcus, was an avid fisherman, devoted husband, dedicated father and wonderful grandfather to his only grandsons Jacob and Harrison.  He was the kind of guy who would give you the shirt off his back - literally.  His life's work was construction and he finished many amazing commercial buildings in Boston proper.  His expertise in doors meant that he was constantly offering to ""take a look at that door for you"" whether at the Temple, his favorite restaurant, or a friend's home. He was one of a kind!  His crazy tshirts and hats, kind and warm presence, contagious laugh and amazing mustache will be surely missed.

"Hey all,
A little while ago we hinted at a few announcements.. nothing life changing but exciting for us nonetheless.

We think we are at the point where we can finally leak some info....

1) It looks like we are going to be opening the taproom a third night.  We have tentatively slated Feb 15th as the first week we'll be open Weds, THURSDAY, and Saturday.  We are still locking down exact hours but they'll likely be VERY similar to the hours we have now.    That week for the extra night looks like a pretty solid bet right now but we will 100% confirm.  

2) We are in the process of 100% confirming a tap-takeover/hang out and have some beers event in Boston for Feb 11th.  We will hopefully have that completely locked down in the next day  or so and will pass along all of the details.  

We also have another location that is very interested in doing a similar event in late Feb... possibly even very early March.  Again, we'll pass along the final details but keep an eye out as both events",1,3.6712,Bog Iron Brewing,92,17,4,Photo,01/27/2016 09:23:27

Available on draft and in bottles. 750ml bottles/$15. Limit 6 per customer.

This is method is based on the Kenyan beverage Urwaga. We will have an extremely limited quantity available for draft and growlers.

Inspiring, bold John Barleycorn! (whisky)
What dangers you can make us scorn!
With ale, we fear no evil;
With whisky, we’ll face the Devil!
The ales so swam in Tam’s head,
Fair play, he didn’t care a farthing for devils.
But Maggie stood, right sore astonished,
Till, by the heel and hand admonished,
She ventured forward on the light;
And, vow! Tom saw an incredible sight!#oldeburnsidebrewing #10penny

Earl (1911-1985) was our grandfather’s brother, and Hill Farmstead Brewery rests upon the land that was once home to him and his 13 siblings.

"I want to give a shout out to Merritt, our Quality Control Specialist here at Rising Tide. While our brewers, cellar, and packaging team members are the front line on the quality war, Merritt works tirelessly in the background to ensure that the beer coming out of the brewery meets our quality control metrics. He also is instrumental in working with me to drive continuing improvements to our beers and process so that we can make more consistent beer more efficiently.

In the photo here, he is working on two projects. First, he's preparing a ""diacetyl force"" to ensure that the VDK (a diacetyl precursor) levels in our fermented beer are below sensory threshold levels. This is a hard-stop go/no-go test for us, allowing us to decide when the beer is actually ready to crash and proceed to yeast harvest and dry-hopping or fining.

He is also setting up the tools and materials needed to run a membrane filtration on some bottled beer. This is a new tool for us, and allows us to collect all of ",1,0.769,Rising Tide Brewing Company,58,2,2,Photo,01/22/2016 09:58:47

"Wednesday at 5:00 in the
OLBC Taproom: Port Hopper Golden Ale Release

Life is about the journey. Often, we're not sure exactly where it is we're going, only that we're definitely moving. Along the way, we meet new people, visit memorable places, have wild adventures, drink good beer. We hop from one port to another, metaphorically for some, literally for others (especially in the Groton area), chasing the next milestone in our fruitful lives.
 
While we understand our journey could end at any time, we look to go as slowly as possible, enjoying every fleeting moment. Life is not a race, and if it is one, Team Outer Light isn't looking to win it. There's so much to discover, and we'd rather watch the whole movie, not just the trailer.
 
On that note, we'd like to introduce Port Hopper Golden Ale. We had a specific goal in mind for Port Hopper: brew a light, sessionable beer with minimal bitterness to appeal to people who enjoy simpler beers, while adding enough juicy hop flavor to keep ",0,0.3321,Outer Light Brewing Company,9,0,1,Photo,01/18/2016 18:35:00

"The taproom will be open from 3 to 7 PM tomorrow and, if all goes right, we should have the Mapled Gratzer on tap.  I was an idiot and filled the brite tank with Mapled Gratzer without first putting the carbonation stone in the side.  It is only a big mistake if you try to fix it by putting the carb stone into the side of a full tank of beer.  Fortunately I am not quite that stupid.  So we carbed the beer like a homebrewer would do in a keg, pressuring the headspace and waiting for the CO2 to diffuse in from above. It takes longer but it works. Bonus Question: Name the law of physics that relates to this process!  The first one to comment correctly will win something.

Saturday we will open the taproom at noon.  Theoretically we will be open until 7 PM but if everyone is home watching the Patriots playoff game and it gets real quiet in the taproom, we might close it a little early.

Remember, each batch of Skywave will have subtle variations and can either be consumed now or cellared up to two years so the flavor and aroma of the Brettanomyces can evolve.

"This Saturday, Jan. 16th, we have some new brews for ya...

Introducing Imperium. Imperium is part of our Frigus project. Frigus barrels are selected and aged in our small barn. The barn is neither heated nor cooled and in the winter drops well below freezing exposing the beer to the natural fluctuations of our climate.Imperium is a wheat wine that was brewed specifically for this project and aged 1 1/2 years in red wine barrels from South Africa. Available in bottles and on draft. 500ml/$16. Limit 6 bottles per person.

The return of III! III (pronounced as “three”) is our hybrid of a Tripel & a Double IPA brewed with brettanomyces. III is brewed with pilsner malt & a touch of unmalted wheat along with copious amounts of hops. This version of III is a blend of 12 month old ale matured in Zinfandel barrels from Napa CA. The barrel maturation softens the hop character & brings out notes of peach, apricot & grapefruit. Available in bottled and on draft. 500ml/$11.50.

"Tomorrow at 5 pm in the OLBC taproom: Woods Devil India Brown Ale Release

Well before Lee Majors used his six million dollar might to battle a furry Andre the Giant, and prior to the Hendersons adopting Harry, Bigfoot captivated our imaginations. In fact, Bigfoot reports are nearly as old as our country itself, with sightings dating back to 1792 in the Pacific northwest.

Connecticut has played its part in Sasquatch lore, with the first sighting occurring in Winsted back in August of 1895. According to the Winsted Evening Citizen, ""a large man, stark naked and covered with hair all over his body, ran out of a clump of bushes and, with fearful yells and cries, made for the woods at lightening [sic] speed where he soon disappeared.""

Three years later, someone spotted it in Naugatuck, where it politely asked, ""How far is it to the next town?"" before disappearing into the woods, leaving 18.5"" footprints in its wake. A dozen or so sightings have been reported since then.

"Wednesday at 5:00 in the OLBC Taproom: Woods Devil India Brown Ale Release

Well before Lee Majors used his six million dollar might to battle a furry Andre the Giant, and prior to the Hendersons adopting Harry, Bigfoot captivated our imaginations. In fact, Bigfoot reports are nearly as old as our country itself, with sightings dating back to 1792 in the Pacific northwest.

Connecticut has played its part in Sasquatch lore, with the first sighting occurring in Winsted back in August of 1895. According to the Winsted Evening Citizen, ""a large man, stark naked and covered with hair all over his body, ran out of a clump of bushes and, with fearful yells and cries, made for the woods at lightening [sic] speed where he soon disappeared.""

Three years later, someone spotted it in Naugatuck, where it politely asked, ""How far is it to the next town?"" before disappearing into the woods, leaving 18.5"" footprints in its wake. A dozen or so sightings have been reported since then.

"On Weds., January 13, 2016, we're excited to release two new beers during normal retail hours:

Works of Love: Anchorage Brewing

A farmstead ale fermented in oak tanks, this beer was brewed in collaboration with our friend Gabe Fletcher of Anchorage Brewing Co. using barley, organic Vermont wheat, organic Vermont oats, fresh apples from Fletcher Orchard, hops, yeast and our well water.

$15 per bottle. 2 bottles per person. 375ml.

Madness & Civilization #5

Madness & Civilization is a panorama of our barrel aging program—oak-aged beers that emerge from their individual silences to find structure and voice as a unified composition. This is the result of an unpredictable state of permanent happenstance—a dialogue with our evolving approach to blending that challenges convention and circumstance. Each release will include multiple threads and is likely to approximate the style of an imperial stout.

Release #5: A blend of Aaron, Everett, and Works of Love: De Molen, all aged in bourbon ",1,0.7854,Hill Farmstead Brewery,225,57,19,Photo,01/09/2016 16:00:00

Lord Hobo Brewing Co
5 Draper Street, Woburn, 781-281-0809
lordhobobrewing.com

Since 2009, Daniel Lanigan’s Cambridge watering hole has been a mecca for beer pilgrims. When the veteran barman announced long-awaited plans to open a brewery in Woburn, he promised big things. The facility itself certainly is large, with more than 40,000 square feet of industrial space. But the reason to go is the cavernous tasting room that once served as the showroom for a stone supplier. IPA lovers can savor a glass of the company’s hoppy flagship brew, Boom Sauce, or sample a steady flow of Lord Hobo’s pilot recipes with their fellow beer adventurers.

"Hey everyone,

After a brief (and frankly...kind of needed) hiatus, Bog Iron has risen from the ashes (not really ashes... we were just closed for one day)... like a PHOENIX (meh... maybe a crow... or hawk... or some other medium-sized fowl) to RECLAIM OUR RIGHTFUL PLACE as the People's Choice #1 Brewery in NORTON!!!  (Seriously... We got an email saying we were voted #1 brewery in Norton. Classic... although... I guess appreciated nonetheless). 

So... yeah.., back open and back to normal biz hours.  We'll be there from 4-9 tonight. 

Tap list:

- Bitter Ex
- Comet Line
- Joe
- Jump Back
- Stinger
- and we still have a little bit of the Braggot pouring (not Devil's Footprint, the non-barrel-aged braggot)

A head's up... we are hoping to have a couple pretty cool announcements coming in the next week or two.  Nothing monstrous but exciting stuff for us. 

Cheers.

This week, we've got two new additions to the draft & growler lineup - a powerful, full-bodied tripel named Avus, and a bready, caramelly doppelbock named Marlow. Also, today we release Trifecta bottles for the very last time...because we're canning our next batch of it! Format switch to make it even more affordable and shareable for our Belgian pale ale fans.

A Farmstead Ale brewed with Vermont organic malted barley, Vermont organic malted wheat, Vermont organic malted oats, hops, chamomile, heather flowers, yeast and our well water, then fermented in an oak tank.

Our love for the landscape, the agriculture, and the spirited reflection of its inhabitants a decade ago has led to the vision of what lies before you. After nearly two years conditioning in wine barrels with our resident microflora, the beer that we have referred to as Juicy is now ready to be enjoyed.

"So you've probably heard that there are anonymously-written, threatening letters being sent to RI breweries? Our good friends at Proclamation Ale have drafted a reply that we have attached below. Crooked Current Brewery believes this reply explains why so many breweries in RI have little to no presence outside of their own four walls. CCB also believes that when the laws change, RI will see a supernova of beer production. That rising tide will then easily lift ALL boats (i.e. retailers, distributors, etc). It's unfortunate that so many stakeholders miss this critical aspect of the equation and only contribute to the stagnation of the brewing industry in RI at their own peril. CCB would love nothing more than to have cans of our Hawaiian Robust Porter or Oatmeal Raisin Stout on the shelf of your local retailer to include the anonymous author of this letter, but until we are allowed to grow through conventional methods available throughout the rest of the country, we will almost all be f",1,3.1235,Crooked Current Brewery,53,1,10,Link,03/31/2016 13:28:15

"Our newest beer, Espo the Ould Bruin, will be on tap #7 this weekend at IndieFerm.  ""Ould bruin"" is Flemish for ""old brown"" and that is the name of the beer style that originated near Brussels Belgium. Conveniently, our local hockey heroes are also called bruins but I haven't really paid much attention to them since I was a kid.  We played street hockey constantly and everyone wanted to be Bobby Orr.  But we all can't be Bobby Orr.  Always the contrarian, I wanted to be Phil Esposito.  So when I think of the old Bruins of the 1970's, I think of Espo first.

Our Ould Bruin isn't that old but it has aged in a barrel for about 3 months.  It was the same barrel that gave us the Bourbon Barrel Aged And Raisin Re-fermented Sour Dubbel that was such a big hit in the taproom this winter.  That beer aged 9 months in the barrel and seems to have taken most of the bourbon flavor with it.  The Espo doesn't seem to have picked up much of that in three months in the barrel but it did develop a nice ",1,2.544,Independent Fermentations Brewing,16,2,8,Status,03/31/2016 09:48:06

I do want to add a little bit though:

In short, some liquor stores and bars are afraid of the possibility that breweries may soon be able to sell their own product to people who want to buy it from them. They are afraid that selling our own beer would put them out of business... much in the way that local bakers who sell their own bread are putting the supermarkets that carry their bread out of business, I suppose. Or maybe it's more like how liquor stores have all gone out of business in every other state in New England?

Here's the reality. If all someone ever drinks is Bucket and my brewery is closer than the closest liquor store, then I'll probably steal your sales. But most craft beer drin",1,2.0282,The Bucket Brewery,63,8,8,Link,03/31/2016 06:31:32

They are even bringing in Boston comedian Steve Sweeney to be the MC for th evening.  Join us if you can.  Here is the link to info and tickets: https://www.facebook.com/tavernonthewharf/?fref=nf

And because Beer vs. Wine seems to be becoming a ""thing"" these days, there is another one on Saturday in New Bedford.

"Wednesday March 30th in the OLBC Taproom: Join us for the Double Release of Hopsteady Red Rye Pale Ale and Barrel Aged Synapse Lapse Imperial IPA

Hopsteady Red Rye Pale Ale
On February 28th, The Hempsteadys joined us in the Brewery to brew our collaboration beer, Hopsteady. While the band unleashed an unplugged set, we brought life to a red rye pale ale for our Outer Light/Hempsteadys Tap Takeover Mini Tour. And, wow! It is next level.

We equipped Hopsteady with a smooth, bready malt background, combining both American pale malt and German crystal malts, before arming the brew with piney Simcoe hops and citrusy Centennial hops. We then detonated Hopsteady with a heavy-handed dry hop addition of TNT hops, a new hop blend released last year. All the while, the Hempsteadys serenaded the brew to sleep each night with their sweet sounds of RAGING ROCK AND ROLL.

This redhead is a true bombshell, exhibiting a curvy, well-rounded body and subtle spice from the rye and Simcoe. She smells swe",1,0.8144,Outer Light Brewing Company,22,1,5,Photo,03/28/2016 20:16:00

As I proudly told her, we have always been advised to ""never hire friends, never hire family, and God forbid, NEVER hire couples"".
Well, we have always done the exact opposite at The Alchemist and it has treated us very well. John and I have successfully surrounded ourselves with our best friends, including 6 couples, who always bring great energy, positive attitude and integrity to our brewery and the beers we make.
This picture of Kenny & Jenny, one of Central Vermont's most beloved couples, makes me smile...

Mayflower Brewing Sets Sail with Cans
March 21, 2015 
Plymouth, MA – Mayflower Brewing Company, America’s Hometown brewery, is pleased to announce that we are shifting the majority of our packaging from bottles to cans.  Starting in April, all of our year-round and seasonal beers will be packaged in 12 oz. cans, rather than bottles.  The only exception to this switch will be Mayflower IPA, which we will continue to package in bottles, as well as cans, as long as we find consumer demand for the bottles.   In addition, we will continue to package our Cooper’s Series limited edition beers in bottles.  

“We’ve always been fans of cans as a package due to their compact size, long shelf-life, and superior portability, but when we started in 2008, cans were not a viable option for us,” says Drew Brosseau, founder and President.  “Our small size and the lack of high quality canning systems for craft brewers made bottles the right choice at that t",1,1.4872,Mayflower Brewing Company,69,17,9,Status,03/21/2016 09:49:21

"One of the best feelings you can have opening a new business is watching the calendar rotate. It never get's old. Something about the newness, and the risk, and the fear of failure that Passing Time pushes back into the corner. I've had 1, 5, 10, and 13 year anniversaries for places I built. But the ones I enjoy the most are the ones in the very beginning. When success is not yet assured. When pangs of anxiety slowly transition from intellectual handcuffs to hearty and totally satisfying chuckles. The Brewery is 9 months old today. Not a big deal as anniversaries go... but a milestone nevertheless. 9 months has seemed like years. But we are still so young. We are growing like crazy, having fun, and making beer we are proud of. I love seeing pictures of folks drinking our beer in Colorado, Buffalo, NYC, Burlington, Portland, and my home town of Boston of course. I am swollen with pride, and gratitude.

"Year 4 Party Update: we're down to one release. We had planned for four, but our unwavering commitment to quality has delayed the timeline on three of them. Our Year 4 DIPA is the hoppiest beer we've ever made - it's ridiculously (actually) green and just needs more time. We'll have it canned and ready sometime next week. It's frustrating, but it's the right move. 

Tomorrow at noon, we're excited to release 250 bottles of our Year 4 Stout, an 8.0% oatmeal stout brewed with maple syrup and aged in apple brandy barrels. Limit 1/customer, $18 each. The stout will also be on tap, along with four kegs from our cellar (tapped one at a time, in the following order as they kick): 

2014 Ever Weisse
2014 Tripel Reserve
2015 Apple Brandy El Lechedor
2015 Second Breakfast

"We will be releasing our Bourbon Barrel-Aged Vendel Imperial Stout at the brewery today beginning at 4pm. We have a very limited amount of this beer, so we haven't been talking about it too much until now.   

The base Vendel beer uses Ghirardelli bittersweet chocolate, cacao nibs and oatmeal to create a delicious beer with a full body and amazing mouthfeel.   Vendel has a 92 on Beer Advocate and is rated the #4 beer in NH.

We took that fantastic base beer and aged it in freshly dumped Heaven Hill Bourbon barrels.  The result is a smooth and subtle sweet bourbon flavor with hints of vanilla and coconut from the wood.  The coffee and chocolate are more subtle than the original, but we think the balance of the coffee, chocolate, bourbon and barrel character is just right!

At our recent anniversary dinner at Cask and Vine, this beer was the favorite of many of the guests.

"""But breweries aren’t like the average industrial plant. They are people magnets, bringing folks in who are curious to try a pint of locally made IPA. In fairly short order, breweries can create little pockets of prosperity in cities that can (and often do) radiate out into the neighborhood. Pretty soon, other businesses see the bustle and consider moving in, too. It doesn’t hurt that breweries often find run-down parts of towns that have great buildings. Once a brewery moves in and refurbishes an old building, it reveals the innate promise of adjacent buildings to prospective renters.""",1,3.3553,Bissell Brothers,423,7,43,Link,03/15/2016 20:37:22

Being born a dual-citizen his mother met his father in Derry 50 years ago while serving in the US Navy as a radioman on submarines.  The family got stationed all over the country from Hawaii to eventually settling in Groton Connecticut.  The brewery was named in honor of his Irish past.  Shebeen means an unlicensed establishment or private house selling alcoholic liquor and typically regarded as slightly disreputable.

"We were honored when the British Beer Company asked us to make a special beer for their Falmouth pub (#BritishBeerFalmouth) about a month ago.  They asked us for a beer for St Patrick's Day that is as ""green"" as possible without actually being colored green.  By ""green"" they meant eco-friendly and hoppy.  With just a month of lead time there was no time for test batches, we would only get one shot at it.

So we thought about it and came up with a recipe using all local ingredients.  And we made it hoppy.  It is on tap now at the BBC Falmouth. Ask for ""Hoppy St. Patrick's Day"".

The recipe includes pilsner, pale, vienna, and rye malts from our three primary suppliers, Valley Malt in Massachusetts (#ValleyMalt), Maine Malt House (#MaineMalt), and Niagara Malt (#NiagaraMalt) in upstate NY.  We used nugget and cascade, hops from our primary hop supplier, Four Star Farms in Massachusetts (#FourStarFarms).  So we kept it 100% local,sustainable, and organic to help make it green.

"On Weds., March 16, we'll release E.

Each 750ml bottle is $30 with a limit of 3 bottles per person.

E. is for Edward (1917-2002), my grandfather, as well as the name of the first beer that I brewed in my brewery on March 30, 2010. E. is for Easter; brewing in Denmark revealed a European tradition of crafting Easter (Påske) beer. Finally, E is for entelechy, the continued actualization of our potential through spirited effort and vision. Thus, in honor of E., to the past and future emprises here on Hill Road, a special fourth anniversary release: Edward fermented with yeasts of Belgian origin, aged in oak barrels, dry-hopped with Galaxy hops and bottle conditioned. 

We will also release a new batch of Everett, our American porter. Each 500ml bottle is $8 with a 6-bottle limit per person.

One more thing...

We will release a new iteration of Arthur, this one conditioned in stainless tanks and dry hopped with Segal Ranch Cascade hops and then bottle conditioned.

"For years (too many years to count :) ), some of us here at Throwback have always wanted to learn to play the guitar. Because of that, and because we think music and beer go so well together, we decided to recruit the talents of local guitarist Chris O’Neill to teach guitar lessons here at Throwback! Over the course of 8 lessons, Chris will teach beginner and intermediate musicians working knowledge of a few simple songs that the group chooses in the first week. He will teach the rhythmic and melodic basics to the group and then create sub-groups to focus on playing pieces targeting to each ability level.

The first lesson will be held in the Brew House on Thursday, March 25th, from 6-7pm and will be held every other week after that. The cost is $80 for the full course of right lessons. This is a big savings compared to private lessons!

I can remember when 31 gallons seemed like a huge volume of beer. Thanks for being so thirsty! -nas",1,0.824,Rising Tide Brewing Company,65,3,2,Photo,03/09/2016 08:50:27

A Mutiny has occurred.

He may be right...
You can find it now at these locations for pints or at a limited few, growler fills.

"I am off to a slow start this morning as I recover from the All-Star Beer Dinner at #NoshTavern last night.  The beers from #Ravenous, #TwoRoads, #Sebago, #Kelsen and #OtterCreek (and IndieFerm) were phenomenal but the food was even better.  The chefs really outdid themselves.  Each course was prepared by a different chef from some of the finest restaurants on the south shore.

Thanks to Peter V, Mike, Dick, and the staff at Nosh for putting it all together.  And if that wasn't enough, the Delta Generators side project band O'Neil Armstrong with Jim C on sax took over when dinner was cleared.  They were incredible too.  

IndieFerm is doing a collaboration beer with the Delta Generators for their CD release party on March 26.  Initial samples from the fermenter are tasting great, it just needs a little time to finish up.

The tap room will be open this weekend Friday 3-7 PM, Saturday 12-6 PM, and Sunday 12-4 PM. Note the early closing Saturday.  We need to close up the taproom and head",1,1.4478,Independent Fermentations Brewing,13,0,1,Status,03/04/2016 11:07:31

An elegant maltiness with mild, almost bittersweet, notes of chocolate and coffee are what highlight this Hoppy Black Pilsner. Magnum Hops impart a clean hop bitterness, while Black Water’s, dry finish allows the Chinook and Tettnang hop spiciness to shine through.  Grab a bottle and dangle your toes in the black water…if you dare!

Mike Renzi, the Enoch Cobb Trust, the BEF, Cape Cod Beer (via the BEF) and our very own Technology Department members have provided generous support and expertise.  Thank you Terry Van Essendelft for building a beast of a computer.  Albert has been able to image and process deep space objects as far away as 12,300,000 light years.  1 light year is equal to 6,000,000,000,000 miles.

"Wednesday at 5pm in the OLBC taproom: Nutmeg State Saison Ale Release

Though officially dubbed ""The Constitution State,"" Connecticut long has been known by another nickname, ""The Nutmeg State."" In the 1800s, Yankees regularly sold nutmeg seed to the South. According to legend, because either some nefarious folk blended in faux ""wooden nutmeg"" with the real nutmeg or because Southerners did not know how to grate the hard foreign seed properly, the South felt gypped in the transactions. Connecticut's unofficial moniker was born.

At Outer Light Brewing Company, we believe in beer as a peacemaker, a beverage providing a commonality of interests to facilitate collaboration and compromise. With that idea in mind, we brewed Nutmeg State Saison.

Nutmeg State Saison blends freshly grated nutmeg with a hint of juicy peaches, a delectable culinary pairing and a nod to fellow Americans both north and south of the Mason Dixon line. Utilizing fruity Belgian farmhouse yeast and bready English malt",1,0.6985,Outer Light Brewing Company,20,0,3,Photo,03/01/2016 14:38:01

"The Nosh All Star Beer Dinner this Thursday really snuck up on me.  So much so that I totally forgot to tell anyone that we will be there as the brewery representing Massachusetts.  Word got out and the event is totally sold out even without my help. 

So why am I telling you this?  I guess I just want to gloat for a moment at being chosen as the brewery to represent Massachusetts.  Other breweries (one from each New England state) include Otter Creek (VT), Sebago (ME), Ravenous (RI), Two Roads (CT), and Kelsen (NH).  

IndieFerm will be pouring Rye and Sage Saison for which Nosh's own Mike Morway will be creating a food pairing.  I don't know what it will be, but it includes smoke infused with Massachusetts-grown Cascade hops grown by our friends at Four Star Farms in Northfield, Mass.  We will also be pouring the extra special Cherry Imperial Stout post-dinner.

"Sputnik I: Jared's Hoppy Wheat! On tap starting today at the brewery, the first beer from our new Sputnik Series. Since starting the brewery 5+ years ago, Rising Tide has released only one commercial batch of beer that wasn't developed by Nathan. That changes starting today! The Sputnik Series is an opportunity for any member of the team at Rising Tide to develop a recipe, pilot it on our pilot system, and if customer feedback and brewery sensory assessment is positive, scale it up to 7bbl batch size in Sputnik, our smallest fermentor. Look for these beers mostly at the tasting room, and in occasional very limited release to distribution.

The first batch of beer from this series is a ""hoppy wheat"" developed by lead production brewer Jared Carr. Brewed with 33% raw unmalted wheat from Maine Grains and copious quantities of Mosaic, Amarillo, El Dorado, and Willamette hops this beer is crisp and boldly aromatic with notes of tangerines, berries, and flowers.

Well friends, asking for consistent weather in Vermont is wishful thinking, which is why we released this beer, ""Wishful Thinking"" at the pub.
